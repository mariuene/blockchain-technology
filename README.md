## What is the meaning of this?

Great question. As a developer it is important to be smart in your choices of technology, and also to keep management happy.
How you ever talked with any management about new technology, and they suggest that the application you are using should be utilizing  blockchains in any way, when there is no reason to use it?
Fear not, there is a solution! Cloning this repository into you project.

By cloning this repository into your project you can say stuff like:
+ I am using blockchain-technology for my static website generator.  
+ Using blockchain-technology and jQuery is very simple.
+ Hey mr/mrs Venture Capitalist, I am creating an app that has no purpose, but I am using blockchain-technology. Can you give me money now?

that's it.


## TODOs

+ realase to npm (for some reason)
